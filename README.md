# Concurrent-Project

In this project, we implement two different variants of the Parallel Delta Stepping algorithm: Dynamic and Static.
in order to compile the code use `make` inside the same folder as the Makefile file.

If you want to compile the code from the terminal, use:

``` g++ -std=c++20 -O3 main.cpp -pthread graph.cpp dijkstra.cpp delta_step_static.cpp delta_step_dynamic.cpp -o main ```

In order to perform a customed benchmarking, use the command after setting a virtual environment if needed:

``` python3 benchmarker.py ```
